# PS4-4.70-WebKit-Exploit
A Work in Progress Webkit Exploit for PS4 Systems running Firmware Version 4.70.

a WEBKIT exploit is still unusable for a full System Exploit without the ability to execute arbitrary code within the KERNEL. This requires a KERNEL exploit.

please also note that this is a basic exploit, which hasnt been fully tested. there will be issues, and the only issues i will be responding to are issues that Developers who understand the Exploitation have opened.

The only reason I am actually going to release this exploit now is because it was patched while I was unable to test. Please be patient while I clean the code and get it ready.<br>
